A competition

Teamwork

I remember once I was on a study tour with my classmates and teachers in Xi'an. It was really a joyful travel that the city is very amazing about its culture, local food and history. After the tour, we are required to write some papers on a specific subjects by groups. Our group got the topic about the history of the style of ancient local building and development in building style in the past few decades.

When we got our job, we first divided our work into several small parts in order to improve the work efficiency . For example there are the material part, the beginning part ,the introduction part and so on. Then we gave different parts to different group members to complete. I was responsible for one of the introduction part. It was really not a easy job for me to write such long paragraphs in a short time. However, as I am quite fond of typing articles, I still completed it successfully in less than three days and then handed it in. Two weeks later, we got a very good mark given by the teachers. Through this unique experience I felt great sense of achievement and fulfilment for playing an important role in a professional and meaningful project.
