The diagram indicates how water used in different purposes in six different areas of the world. These areas can be divided into two groups. The first group contains two developed areas, North America and Europe while the second group consists of other four developing areas.

First it is noticeable that the principal use for water in the four developing regions is agricultural use. In Central Asia, the agricultural use is over seven times of the sum of other two uses. Even in South America, the water used in agriculture and home still do not even occupy one-third of the total water used. 

The biggest difference between water usage in the two groups is that the percentage of the water used in industry is definitely more than other two parts of water usage in the developed areas. The industrial use is about fifty percent in the two areas, while other two parts consume another half. Meanwhile, the agricultural use is far more than domestic use and is almost two to three times the domestic counterpart respectively.
