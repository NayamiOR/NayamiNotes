I remember when I was still in grade four in primary school. Once I was browsing a software bank, looking for some softwares just for fun, I suddenly noticed a software with little cute green icon. I downloaded it an then found it a development environment used to run C program. After that I told my father bought me a book of the software' developer since I felt quite curious about it. Then I started my learning in programming. I still remenber the first time when I made the program print a simple sentence, I was extremely exciting and felt great sense of achievement since it was such an amazing thing to make your own program and make them work as you want. So far I've keeping learning programming for a few years, after that I have tried a few different programming languages and new technical frameworks that I have never tried them before. Everytime I learn new things I can get a lot novelty value.
