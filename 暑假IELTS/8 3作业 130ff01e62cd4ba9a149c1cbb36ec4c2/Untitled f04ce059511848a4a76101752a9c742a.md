The diagrams indicate how the money is raised and spent of a USA children's charity in 2016.

The income about 86 percent of revenue sources comes from donated food which is the biggest part in the income that is nearly six times the remainder. The remainder is then devided into other five groups. Then income of community contributions then takes about ten percent of the income after the donated food's part. The income of investment and government grants are both the least and only takes about  0.4 percent in total.

There are only three parts in the expenditure chart and program services take the most of them, about ninty-six percent. The remainders are devided in two parts which take about 2.6 and 1.6 percent.

Overall, the spending and the income is basically balanced while the income is a bit more which means the demand is met. In each chart, there are a biggest part which accounts for a lot more than the sum of other parts.
