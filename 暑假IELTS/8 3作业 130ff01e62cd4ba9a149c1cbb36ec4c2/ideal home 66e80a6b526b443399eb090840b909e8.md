# ideal home

I think my ideal home will be in the urban area, better near the city centre since I like busy place. I can get everything I need since there are lots of shops, restaurants and malls. I like the crowded atmosphere as well. Besides it is convenient to hang out in the daily life. In downtown, you will never be lack of entertainment. What's more, the transpotation in downtown is always extremely convenient.

Besides, I would like to choose a loft style flat with about 5 metres height inside since it's both comfortable and cheap as well. The double-floor's design can ensure enough space to live. Living in a smaller space can sometimes makes me feel cosy instead of a big room with maybe more than sixty square metres' area.

Inside the house I'd like to have a two bedrooms, a kitchen, a bathroom and a study which I can do my work and read inside. It's better have plenty of space for me to store my groceries. I have lots of books and all kinds of tools which require a big space to place. Maybe the bedroom and bed inside have to be very big since I love lying on my bed to relax.

In short, I prefer smaller flat to a big house.
