I remember a friends of mine in my middle school whose name is Billy.

He is quite tall and slim as well.

He was my schoolmate and is in the same grade with me. 

We first met each other when grade seven on the school bus. 

He sit besides me and then we started chatting. 

We used to talk about and play all kinds of games. 

I found him very talkative, kind and humor. 

Besides, he is quite a hardworking student. 

Once he was taking part in a English speech competition. 

During that period I could see him practicing his speech every day. 

By his hard practicing, he finally won the first prise in the competition easily. 

From my point of view he is really a hardworking person that I can learn a lot from him such as work hard.
