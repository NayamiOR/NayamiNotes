I usually visit East Nanjing Road, a famous long walking street which is extremely popular in the tourists in my free time to relax. I visit there very often since I've lived nearby for over a decade. I live on East Beijing Road, in the city centre of Shanghai, which is very close to East Nanjing Road for about ten minutes walk. That's really a busy place. There locates plenty of different restaurants, shops selling all kinds of stuffs such as snacks, medecines, jewelries and electronic devices. When it is summer or winter holiday, I often hang out with my friends together and we always choose to meet at the same McDonalds restaurant. It is really a pleasure to find a restaurant, sit down and chat with my friends in the afternoon. Sometimes we also go to the air conditioned book mall nearby when it's really hot.

In my memory, this street didn't change a lot. Some shops closed and then new owners moved in. However, that not so noticeable actually. 

I love this street since it carries my childhood memory and I can get everything I want here. Besides, it is really beautiful especially when it's dark. The foot traffic does not decline although it's late every day. During the evening and night, people can see beautiful lighting and the shops dont close as well.
