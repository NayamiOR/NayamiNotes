Somebody considers that when designing a building, the outward appearance is more important than the intended use. However, I do not think this is quite reasonable.

First I would like to say that as the land resources are now scarce, buildings have to  be useful enough in order to make full  use of space.

As a building is designed, it will then probably be built in the future. That will take a lot of people a huge amount of money and time. Building a tall, splendid building is really a luxurous thing that it can take years and even decades to finish the program and costs several billions in the same time. In this way, the designers have to think of the input and output of money and inevitably looking forward to the return. Since this expection is closely related to the intended use in the designing part，the designers shouldn't put outward appearance in the first priority. Otherwise if there are some problems inside the house, people may be not willing to make use of the building. For example, the layout may be not useful engough or have some structural problems which is unsafe or inconvenient to work inside. Besides, the fee required to use the building is also very important since the developers have to ensure that  As the building is less used, the output of wealth will definitely decrease soon and both the developers and users will not be happy to face this kind of situation. They are unlikely to get plenty of profits and then lose great amount of money.
