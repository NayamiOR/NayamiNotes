I think, no. The change of season often cause a few problems. While this time, it can be easy for people to get sick. As the weather is usually not very stable, people can easily get a cold. Besides, the pollen released by flowers can cause serious allergy to the pedestrians. What's more, people have to change lots of their clothes while season changing. Many furniture, clothes, quilts can go mouldy easily as well.

# 2

I definitely will keep a pet in the future. I prefer a cat. Keeping a pet is a good method for people to release their stress come from daily life and is good for their mental health. It is easy for people to get relaxed from playing with a fluffy tiny animal. Although sometimes people might need to do some annoying work such as cleaning. However, it can be worthwhile.

# 3

No. Sunglasses can usually protect our eyes from the strong light from the sun. However, I'm not a fan of sunglasses. My first reason is that it's expensive to buy a pair of sunglasses. It's affordable but unnecessary for me. Secondly sunglasses doesn't suit me as I don't think it's very cool as well. Without a sunglasses I can have eye contact more with other people, this can sometimes make my communication better.
