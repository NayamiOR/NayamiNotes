Some people guess that everyone will be able to get free books and newspapers online and abandon printed ones in the future. I'm disagree with this question.

Firstly I have to query the premise in the question. From my point of view, books will never be free since they contain the knowledge, experience, inspiration and thought of the authors. The price of these things can't be free though the cost for the medium such as paper and other materials declined. If these knowledge becomes free, the authors may not tend to write books so actively.

Then I would like to say that, even if the books wiil be free in the future, there will still be a few people ~~buy~~buying printed books. Those people are usually happy to pay extra money for better reading experience and quality. Take myself as an example, I will definitely choose printed book if that doesn't cost too much.
