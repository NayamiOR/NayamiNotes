# Notes

柱状图可能几个加起来不到100%

3time than the sum改成about three quarters，剩下四分之一被分掉了

在Amman组内对比中landfill占优势但不大，还需要强调被incineration处理的很多

第二group内单个城市要进行组内对比！

Madrid用了比较even的方式

还要注意一下数据罗列

The diagram below indicated that how the garbage is disposed in the four cities, Toronto, Madrid, Kuala Lumpur and Amman, which can be divided into two groups. One involves Toronto and Amman and the second one consists of Madrid and Kuala Lumpur.

First it is quite clear that in the first group, landfill is the major method to deal with the waste in both cities . Waste disposed using landfill in Toronto takes a big part of about 75 percent which is almost three times than the sum of waste handled using other three methods. ~~Even~~ in Amman, the waste disposed using landfill still exceeds the ~~counterpart~~ of incineration for about 10 percent.

In the other two cities, the most common approach is using incineration which takes a big part of 40 to 55 percent. The ~~counterpart~~ of landfill and recycling do not differ very much since the difference is about 5 percent.
