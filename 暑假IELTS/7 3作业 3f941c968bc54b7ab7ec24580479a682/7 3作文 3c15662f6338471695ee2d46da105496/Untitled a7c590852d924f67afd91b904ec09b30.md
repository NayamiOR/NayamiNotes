While there are a lot of children of age four go to school in some countries, somebody believe that may cause some problems to the relationships between children and parents. From my point of view, The disadvantages have definitely exceeded the advantages.

Learning early is exactly has some advantages. It can make the children more independent earlier since they left their parents（没有周末假期，晚上不回家？）. And they have more time for learning by contrast with those children who go to school at the age sever or later. However that also cause quite a lot issues in the same time. The first problem is that all of the children depend on their parents especially their mother very much. If children go to school early, they may get psychological defect since they leave their parents although it usually takes only several hours（题目没讲具体是几个小时，一般小朋友去上学，应该是一天~使用了题目没有给的，自己主观想象的条件！！另外逻辑强推，离开麻麻，和心理变态之间的距离是得很远的—墙推）  every day. Besides, it may not helps children exercise their ability to deal with the relationships because they don't know how to make friends which has to be taught by their parents at all.（at all 表示的否定，但是which这个句子是肯定句~人类的幼崽的是可以社交的好吗？而且已经四岁了，应该懂一些社交了，比如和neighbors~） Last but not least,  as children's mental development is yet weak, they can not study well when they are too young.（四岁的教材和课程不一定就是很难的，大概率会依照学生实际情况去设置） They may even be weariness of learning in this way.

To sum up, I believe that children should not go to school to early. The disadvantages far more than the advantages.
