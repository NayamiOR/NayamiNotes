First I think the prmise seriously has to be queried. Books will never be free since they contain the knowledge, experience, inspiration and thought of the authors. These things can never be free though the cost for the medium such as paper and ink declined because the value of a paper book doesn't only come from materials. Besides, if these knowledge becomes free, the authors may not tend to write books so actively.

Then I would like to say that, even if the books will be free online in the future, there will definitely be a few people who still buy printed books. Many readers are happy to pay extra money for the unique feeling of paper books. (for the unique reading experience brought by paper books.)In the same time, the books are usually very collectible.(why?)

What's more, when books and newspapers become free online, the value doesn't dissappear. Instead, the value transfers（这个词可以用，但是最好信息合并） in order to keep the authors' benefits. For instance, the benefits may comes from advertisements in books or websites. The websites may get income from those richer people who are attracted by the goods on the website and pay for them . Some of the benefits can used to offer free books to other users.
