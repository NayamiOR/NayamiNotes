As a few months ago I abandoned the Netease cloud music and turned to use Spotify, so these days I listen to Japanese music more and I paid greater attention to some musicians I cared less before. As you might know him already, probably not. I'd like to introduce you a musician whose name is Sawano Hiroyuki or zeyehongzhi in chinese, and his own music.

He is known as a great composer and arranger who did great job in a huge number of famous Japanese anime such as Attack on Titan. Differ from modern pop music, his music style is sometimes very changable. He is good at writing songs with very grand and powerful or sometimes hot-blooded by using elements like bel canto, symphony. Sometimes he also combine bass, drum kit and piano together into a rock song like shout.

Besides, in our countries he is more famous for his own approach while naming a song. Take shout as an example, Sawano change the letter o into zero and sometimes also written as the empty set symbol in methametics. My favorite album of his is called 2V-ALK. This wierd name comes from his new company called vv-alkline. Last but not least, his most famous song is called aliez. Which maybe means a lie from a to z, a unique and surprising meaning.

Finally I would like to say, he is really a genius in arranging and a master in musical instrument. That's my favourite musician.
