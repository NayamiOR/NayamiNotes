# Months

Certainly August. In summer holiday I usually have a lot of work or class I have to deal with so may be my July will be busy. Then August will be much more easier and pleasing as I don't mind if the weather is hot. Besides, I can have ice creams often.

As I'm free in August, I can do a lot of thing I can't do freely. In one day, I can choose to play video games for hours, hang out with my friends or stay in the air conditioned room and devote my self programming for a whole day. Sometimes my parents also take me out for a short trip to nearby cities.

To me the life in August is perfect that there is almost no trouble which can bother me.

Actually I haven't think about this question before since I like almost every season or month in a year. If you ask me, the answer is probably janurary. Although I enjoy the early winter weather, I don't like the environment in January since it's too freezing. I hate the feeling of a splited lips. Besides, it is usually the time I have to take exams. I have to work extremely hard and bear great pressure at the same time.

# Films

In fact I'm not a person who is picky about film to watch. Maybe I like comedy film or action film more. But I definitely keen on old, classical, famous and acclaimed films. For example, last few months I've watched and reviewed the film Let the bullets fly for more than five times. The performance of the famous actors Jiangwen, Geyou and Zhourunfa is totally perfect. The plot of the dinner party is extremely classical and is really breath taking. In short, the plot and the performance is the most important to me.

I still consider cinemas as the best place to watch a film because only there can offer the best quality of the film and zhe atmosphere is also very suitable to enjoy a long story. But as I seldom go out, usually I just watch films at the dormitory, using my JBL speaker and computer screen.

I guess I'm less keen on horror films. Not because I'm easy to get scared, but I'm not interested in that kind of exciting feeling. Horror films nowadays seldom make me frightened. I'd rather to watch an action film.

# Computers

Well, in fact I have to say a computer is really useful and essential for my studies. First I can use it to find learning materials much easier. There are a lot of educational videos about all subjects like maths and physics on Bilibili and Youtube. Google and Baidu document library can help me to get the past papers and text books. They helped me a lot while facing the exams and when I didn't understand on the class.

Sometimes I also use my laptop to take class on online mooc, learn about programming. As I've kept this hobby for more than five years, it's really helpful to take such professional classes online since it's really hard to find a systematic class nowadays.

Besides a computer is also suitable for editting. I'm using a note website called notion and I put all my notes here. It make the notes easier to manage. The feature of markdown documents makes editting more efficient than office word documents.
