# 10月中旬presentation

This time I would like to talk about something different. When I was preparing I wanted to try something more uncommon. So a few days ago I tried to think about the situation of niche and small interest groups and the public's attitude to those groups.

Here the niche groups refer to those minorities who have uncommon interest which may not be understood by other people.  Such as some special music style or culture.

I started to think about this topic when the government said the perverted taste like girlish male stars should be changed and claimed that men must be manly. At first I was happy to hear about this new since I hated this kind of social phenomenon should be changed as well. But, to be honest, I don't think it is necessary to be CORRECTED. People's taste and interest should be free.

Besides, the current tendency that people always claims that something should be corrected is wrong in my opinion. Every kind of legitimate interest have to be respected. Most importantly, if people keep cracking down the uncommon interests, maybe the next victim will be ourselves. I mean, who don't have any uncommon interests. People ought to be more inclusive nowadays.
